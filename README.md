# 🐧 Project: Linux CLI Fundamentals and Security Tool Deployment

## Project Goal
This project demonstrates foundational proficiency in the **Linux command line interface (CLI)** within an Ubuntu environment, covering basic input/output, variable manipulation, utility management, and the deployment of key network security tools.

## 🛠️ Commands and Skills Demonstrated

| Activity Category | Commands Used | Key Skills Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic I/O & Variables** | `echo`, `expr` | **Displaying output** and performing basic **arithmetic operations** (integer math) directly within the shell. |
| **System Utility** | `clear` | **Managing the terminal environment** and maintaining a clean workspace. |
| **Package Management** | `apt install`, `apt remove`, `apt reinstall` | **Installing, removing, and updating software** on a Debian-based system (Ubuntu) using the **Advanced Package Tool (`apt`)**. |
| **Security Tools Deployment** | `install suricata`, `install tcpdump`, `remove suricata`, `reinstall suricata` | **Deployment and management of network security tools:** **Suricata** (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System - IDPS) and **tcpdump** (packet sniffer) for network traffic analysis. |
